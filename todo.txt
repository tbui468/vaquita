    Efficiency of dbms can be estimated with number IO operations

    Use gdb to walk through code (Cherno recommended debugger to learn to read code)
        https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Debugging.html
        Try it on the xv6 (or the risc-v version) - would gdb even work with vm?

**********************************Client**************************
The dbms should run as a server (rather than embedded) and have a scheduler that
    gives connecting clients the illusion that they have sole access to the dbms

    Seems like mysql uses tcp sockets

    Some basic SQL implemented in parser:
        vdb > connect 3000;
        vdb > show databases;
        vdb > create database school;
        vdb > open school;
        
        vdb:school > show tables;
        vdb:school > create table students (name string, age int, grad bool);
        vdb:school > describe students;
        vdb:school > insert into students (name, age, male) values ("Bob", 12, true);
        vdb:school > insert into students (name, age, male) values ("Kate", 13, false), ("John", 14, true);
        vdb:school > update students set name = "Jim", age = 12, male = true where id = 2;
        vdb:school > delete from students where id = 1;
        vdb:school > select * from students;
        vdb:school > select id, name from students;
        vdb:school > select id, name, male from students where age >= 12;
        vdb:school > drop table students;
        vdb:school > close school;

        vdb > drop database school;
        vdb > exit;

    static struct VdbDatum vdbexpr_do_eval(struct VdbExpr* expr, struct VdbRecord* rec, struct VdbSchema* schema) <----FINISH THIS GUY
        evaluate all unary (VDBT_MINUS and VDBT_NOT)
        evaluate more binary logical expressions (VDBT_AND and VDBT_OR)

    Use sample data to make sure SQL kinda works
        https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/index.html
            use data here in sample database

            create table planets (name string, 
                                  mass float,
                                  diameter int, 
                                  density int, 
                                  gravity float,

                                  global_magnetic_field bool); <----some of these will be NULL

            write SQL script to make database solar_system
            tables planets, moons, dwarf_planets


    to update
        struct VdbCursor* cursor = vdbcursor_init_at(h, table_name, key);
        initialize a cursor at key
        write record there

    to delete
        make sure increment skips deleted records
        initialize a cursor at key
        delete record there

    add more test cases
        use python to automate running of program with test scripts
        
    need checks to prevent table manipulation/creation/dropping when database not open - segfaulting now

    need to return error if table doesn't exist when insert/select/update/delete - segfaulting now

    Connect cli and the database tree to get useful data - play with MariaDB or MySQL to see how they print outputs
        > open school
            database school opened
        > select * from students
            +----+------+-----+
            | id | name | age |
            +----+------+-----+
            |  1 | John |  23 |
            |  2 | Kate |  12 |
            |  3 | Timm |  22 |
            +----+------+-----+
            3 rows in set
        > close school
            database school closed
            [what message?]

    pager eviction policy
        make db really big so that the program crashes because of too much memory allocated, then evict pages to fix it
        Or just manually limit number of pages allowed to hold at a time
        Use O_DIRECT to bypass OS pager

    Foreign keys to connect two or more tables
        joins will be needed here

    Custom keys
        Unique or not?
        Have to rewrite tree to split/merge based on where inserted (since it will not be in order anymore)

    Concurrency - need to get read/write locks on file

    Transactions - need a way of rolling back changes if transaction fails

    Logging - database should never be in inconsistent state if system fails
