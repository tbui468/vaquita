    Efficiency of dbms can be estimated with number IO operations

    Use gdb to walk through code (Cherno recommended debugger to learn to read code)
        https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Debugging.html
        Try it on the xv6 (or the risc-v version) - would gdb even work with vm?

    Use Yahoo or some other database standard metric to focus on core features

**************************************************************************
    fetch <---------------START HERE
        First record shows up fine, but second does not....
        For some reason if vdb_fetch_record is called in main.c, students.vtb is empty <-----investigate this!!!!
            remove some code to see what is causing the problem
        

    Instead of using datacells size field, just call it 'free' - this allows us to
        avoid having to compute it everytime we need to check block - just recompute it when adding a record

    Deal with situation when leaves/interns are full
        splitting leaves
        splitting internal nodes if:
            root
            parent of internal node is below capacity
            parent of internal node is at/above capacity

    Fetch record

    update records

    delete records

    Concurrency - need to get read/write locks on blocks

    Transactions - need a way of rolling back changes if transaction fails

    Logging - database should never be in inconsistent state if system fails

    Execution engine
        selection WHERE
        projection SELECT 

        See SQL-92 for the standard to quality as 'supporting SQL'

        Foreign keys
