    Efficiency of dbms can be estimated with number IO operations

    Use gdb to walk through code (Cherno recommended debugger to learn to read code)
        https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Debugging.html

**************************************************************************
    write code to simulate full internal leaf
    
    split internal for three cases (if root, if parent has enough space, if parent is full)

    Finish functions for creating / dropping tables

    Rewrite with in memory B-Tree only

    Adding paging later
