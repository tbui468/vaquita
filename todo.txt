TODO:
    Use gdb to walk through code (Cherno recommended debugger to learn to read code)
        https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Debugging.html
        Try it on the xv6 (or the risc-v version) - would gdb even work with vm?

    Adding records
        Add key to struct VdbRecord
        Need debug functions to print out nodes/leaves <------START HERE
            need to know if records were successfully added
            Then need a way to traverse tree and track nodes traversed (required for splitting)

    Fetching records

    Deleting records
        Should keys be reused?  How does sqlite do it? - sqlite allows reuse if user desires

    Switch to binary search in _tree_traverse_to_leaf (just using linear scan right now)

    Limit how many blocks are in buffer cache at a time - use least-recently used eviction policy

    Refactor vdb.c to make it more readable - it's a bit messy now

    Allow fetch to get range of records by primary key - first step into creating an execution engine here

    How to implement execution engine:
        SQL parser and VM to run the bytecode
