    Efficiency of dbms can be estimated with number IO operations

    Use gdb to walk through code (Cherno recommended debugger to learn to read code)

        Try it on the xv6 (or the risc-v version) - would gdb even work with vm?

    If value is integer when schema type is float, it becomes 0.00 - fixed this bug

    Use sample data to make sure SQL kinda works
        https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/index.html
            use data here in sample database

            create table planets (name string, 
                                  mass float,
                                  diameter int, 
                                  density int, 
                                  gravity float, 
                                  escape_velocity float, 
                                  rotation_period float, 
                                  length_of_day float, 
                                  distance_from_sun float, 
                                  perihelion float, 
                                  orbital_period float, 
                                  orbital_velocity float, 
                                  orbital_inclination float, 
                                  orbital_eccentricity float, 
                                  obliquity_of_orbit float, 
                                  mean_temperature int, 
                                  surface_pressure float, 
                                  number_of_moons int, 
                                  ring_system bool, 
                                  global_magnetic_field bool); <----some of these will be NULL

            write SQL script to make database solar_system
            tables planets, moons, dwarf_planets

    when inserting, attribute names should be parsed as expressions (being parsed as single tokens now)
        can remove parse_identifier_tuple function then

    evaluating expressions now requires struct VdbRecord* - is this necessary?
        should just need the schema
        push dealing with records to vm.c
            will need a bytecode generator and vm if we take this step

    Remove key field in record and in node- this is now a regular attribute in records now
        will need to rewrite some functions that read keys from node buffers

    Don't need to specify column names if inserting all values

    If block size is 256 and block header size is 128, it crashes if not enough room to store schema data
        the attribute names take too much space.  Need an overflow block for attribute strings.

    Does struct VdbDatum really need to store struct VdbString as a pointer?
        couldn't it just save the value itself, and leave the pointer to only refer to the d.as.Str->start?
        this would simplify our code a lot and minimize the chances of a memory leak

    cursor abstraction:
        cursors are created when starting a new transaction, and destroyed when transaction ends (commit or not)
        a cursor is associated with a table AND an ordering (eg, by which column the records are indexed)
        a cursor has a closed and open state:
            <open stmt> opens a cursor
            <close stmt>, <commit stmt>, or <rollback stmt> closes cursor
        cursor may be before first record or one past the last record
        fetch - moves cursor to next record and returns that record
        delete - deletes record pointed to by cursor - moves cursor to next record after deletion
        update - updates records pointed to by cursor

    to update
        struct VdbCursor* cursor = vdbcursor_init_at(h, table_name, key);
        initialize a cursor at key
        write record there

    to delete
        make sure increment skips deleted records
        initialize a cursor at key
        delete record there

    add more test cases
        use python to automate running of program with test scripts
        
    need checks to prevent table manipulation/creation/dropping when database not open - segfaulting now

    need to return error if table doesn't exist when insert/select/update/delete - segfaulting now

    pager eviction policy
        make db really big so that the program crashes because of too much memory allocated, then evict pages to fix it
        Or just manually limit number of pages allowed to hold at a time
        Use O_DIRECT to bypass OS pager

    Concurrency - need to get read/write locks on file
        pager can take care of this

    Transactions - need a way of rolling back changes if transaction fails
        need a way to track undos (a stack???)

    Logging - database should never be in inconsistent state if system fails
        sqlite uses a write-ahead log

    Foreign keys to connect two or more tables
        joins will be needed here

    Custom keys
        Unique or not?
        Have to rewrite tree to split/merge based on where inserted (since it will not be in order anymore)

    views

    unique constraint

    not null constraint

    group by

    joins
    
    split into client and server - use tcp sockets to connect client to server
