    Efficiency of dbms can be estimated with number IO operations

    Use gdb to walk through code (Cherno recommended debugger to learn to read code)
        https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Debugging.html
        Try it on the xv6 (or the risc-v version) - would gdb even work with vm?

    Look here for two star databases:

        One has around 100,000 stars, one has about 200,000 stars/objects and one database has over 2.5 billion(!) stars

*******************data****************************

Use sample data to make sure SQL kinda works
    https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/index.html
    also look at moons/rings/comets/asteroids fact sheets

        create table planets
        create table moons
        create table rings
        create table comets
        create table asteroids

*******************************TODO**************************************************
    update
        struct VdbCursor* cursor = vdbcursor_init_at(h, table_name, key);
        initialize a cursor at key
        write record there

    tree.c/cursor (in vdb.c) needs a massive rewrite - it's too confusing now
        start with caching the schema instead of dynamically allocating/freeing it in every tree function
        abstraction between cursor and tree is fuzzy - what responsibility should each have?
        traverse_to_first_leaf is no longer necessary - remove it

        cursor abstraction:
            cursors are created when starting a new transaction, and destroyed when transaction ends (commit or not)
            a cursor is associated with a table AND an ordering (eg, by which column the records are indexed)
            a cursor has a closed and open state:
                <open stmt> opens a cursor
                <close stmt>, <commit stmt>, or <rollback stmt> closes cursor
            cursor may be before first record or one past the last record
            fetch - moves cursor to next record and returns that record
            delete - deletes record pointed to by cursor - moves cursor to next record after deletion
            update - updates records pointed to by cursor

    Eviction policy
        make db really big so that the program crashes because of too much memory allocated, then evict pages to fix it
        Or just manually limit number of pages allowed to hold at a time
        Use O_DIRECT to bypass OS pager

        implement LRU policy for now, but make it easy to swap algorithms (such as to clock policy or using a nn)

    allocated_memory variable show -52 bytes when runnging sol.sql
        I suspect that a non-wrapper allocation function is being called somewhere
        OR free_w has a wrong size argument

    Probably should cached schema and use that whenever vdbmeta_get_schema is called rather than having to
        manually free it every single time - error prone and just makes everything look messier

    User defined primary keys
        Need to make sure keys are unique
        Need to rewrite B-Tree to not always append at end

    Aggreate functions (count, max, ave, etc)

    Group by, etc

    Subqueries

    Add tests for errors:
        insert_invalid_col_name.sql <----should report error message.  Silenty failing now when mistyped, and hard to debug
            create table planets (name string, moons int);
            insert into planets (name, gravity) values ("Earth", 9.81); //this should report error instead of setting moons to null and ignoring 9.81

        *will probably need to introduce runtime errors here (we have tokenizing and parsing(?) errors already)

    single line comments
        use c-style //

    multiline comments
        use c-style /**/

    Don't need to specify column names if inserting all values
        insert into planets values (...), (...);

    If block size is 256 and block header size is 128, it crashes if not enough room to store schema data
        the attribute names take too much space.  Need an data blocks and overflow blocks for colunm names

    Compile AST to bytecode that runs on vm
        How could this work?
            what instructions are needed?
        when inserting, attribute names should be parsed as expressions (being parsed as single tokens now)
            can remove parse_identifier_tuple function then

            insert into planets (name, mass) values ("Mars", 242), ("Venus", 242), ("Earth", 534);

        
    need checks to prevent table manipulation/creation/dropping when database not open - segfaulting now

    need to return error if table doesn't exist when insert/select/update/delete - segfaulting now

    primary keys rework
        user MUST define primary key using 'primary key' keywords
        'auto' keyword will make an autoincrementing column value
        'constraint' can be used to set primary key
        should allow this:
            create table planets (name string, moons int);
            create table planets (name string not null, id int auto);
            create table planets (name string, moons int, primary key

    Concurrency - need to get read/write locks on file
        pager can take care of this

    Transactions - need a way of rolling back changes if transaction fails
        need a way to track undos (a stack???)

    Logging - database should never be in inconsistent state if system fails
        sqlite uses a write-ahead log

    Foreign keys to connect two or more tables
        joins will be needed here

    Custom keys
        Unique or not?
        Have to rewrite tree to split/merge based on where inserted (since it will not be in order anymore)

    views

    unique constraint

    not null constraint

    group by

    joins
    
    split into client and server - use tcp sockets to connect client to server
